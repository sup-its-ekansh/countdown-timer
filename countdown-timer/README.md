This project displays a live countdown to a target date (set to tomorrow by default). The timer calculates the remaining days, hours, minutes, and seconds by subtracting the current time (Date.now()) from the target timestamp, then breaking it down using time unit conversions (1000ms → 1s, 60s → 1m, etc). Smooth card-flip animations enhance each unit's transition. Responsive layout and styled components are used for a modern, dynamic UI.

you can set the timer from the code- in app.tsx file 

for styling variable i have used that are in style-guide.md

Thank You
